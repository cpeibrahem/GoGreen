## How ReEn agrees with and supports Neom's vision
According to its vision in the energy sector, NEOM will rely on renewable energy
(clean energy) by 100%.
It will also be the most advanced energy center in the world, and the first in the
world to develop an integrated renewable energy system on a large scale.
Therefore, the ReEn System project option would be an ideal and supportive of
NEOM's vision for leadership in renewable energy, supporting the global
ecosystem to be safer and more stable.

## ReEn impact on the circular and sustainable economy
Recycling waste and converting it into energy, organic fertilizer and other raw
products will be an important economic source for the city of NEOM, instead of
its importance in terms of the environment, it will be a stable source of income
for the city, which will become a global tourism center for all countries of the
world, as the rate of consumption in Neom will be high in exchange for that.
The consumed resource will become a long-term circular economy in supplying
the city with energy and other resources. This means that the value of products
and materials will be preserved for as long as possible at the end of their life by
recycling them again and again to create additional value.
